# Contributing

### Step 0: Making your project contribution ready

1) Ensuring the readiness of your code/project
2) Ensure that your code and project is in a working condition and performs its intended task.
3) Preparing the README : 
      The README file of your project must contain the following sections:
      - **A brief discription of the project**: What task does this task automate
      - **A Section titled Pre-requisites** : What will need to be installed on the user's system in order to get your automation running
      - **A Section titled How to use** : How to go about using your project from the end-user perspective (may as well add pictures/videos explaining them)
      - (Optional)**A "Created By" section** : This section contain information about the creator/creators of the project (you can also add link to your profile here)

### Step 1: Contributing an Automation

1) Look for an existing open [issue](#issues) to work upon or create a new one explaining your idea (just make sure an issue exist before opening a new pull request)

2) [Fork repository](https://github.com/Arsenic-ATG/Awesome-Automations)

3) Copy project into the forked repo under the ['Automation'](Automations/) folder

4) Issue a **Pull Request** : 

    Create a [pull request](#pull-request) with proper description to merge your changes into the main repo ( the one hoted by [Arsenic](https://github.com/Arsenic-ATG) )

5) Keep track of your pull request : 

    That’s it!🎉 Wait for your pull request to be approved and merged. If there are any discrepancies, an admin
will add a comment requesting you to make the necessary changes and your pull request will have to be
updated accordingly.
