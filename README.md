# python-automations
```who likes to do those useless ,old and time consuming tasks when you can automate them.``` 

in this repostiory I would be keeping all my python automations that will make some tedious daily taska easier.

## language used
- Python

### NOTE üßê
all the projects that will grow too large to become stand alone projects will be added to another new repository accordingly

### But How to run them ? ü§®
- most of the stuff will be plain python scripts which will only require you to have **python installed on your device** and an **IDE/text editor** to see and make changes to the scripts on your system.
- whenever a project will use a new library then I will get you know about it.
