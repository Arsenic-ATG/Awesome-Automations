  <h1 align="center">👩‍💻Python-Automations👨‍💻</h1>
  
---

> who likes to do those useless ,old and time consuming tasks manually when you can automate them.

in this repostiory I would be keeping all my python automations that will make some tedious daily tasks easier and faster.

## language used
- Python 🐍

## Some Notable Projects: 🧐
1. [Multiclipboard](https://github.com/Arsenic-ATG/python-automations/tree/master/Multiclipboard)
2. [Phone-number and E-mail extractor](https://github.com/Arsenic-ATG/python-automations/tree/master/Phone%20%26%20Email%20Extrator)

### NOTE
all the projects that will grow too large to become stand alone projects will be added to another new repository accordingly

### But How to run them ? 🤨
- most of the stuff will be plain python scripts which will only require you to have **python installed on your device** and an **IDE/text editor** to see and make changes to the scripts on your system.
- if you don't have python on your machine then you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- further instructions are specific for specifc projects and can be seen in their READMEs
