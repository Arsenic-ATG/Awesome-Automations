# python-automations
```who likes to do those useless ,old and time consuming tasks manually when you can automate them.``` 

in this repostiory I would be keeping all my python automations that will make some tedious daily tasks easier and faster.

---

## language used
- Python

### NOTE 🧐
all the projects that will grow too large to become stand alone projects will be added to another new repository accordingly

### But How to run them ? 🤨
- most of the stuff will be plain python scripts which will only require you to have **python installed on your device** and an **IDE/text editor** to see and make changes to the scripts on your system.
- if you don't have python on your machine then you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- further instructions are specific for specifc projects and can be seen in their READMEs
