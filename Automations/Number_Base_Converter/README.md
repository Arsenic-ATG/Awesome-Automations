# Number Base Converter

The Base Converter is a program written in C++ that allows users to convert numbers between different bases, ranging from base 2 to base 32.

## Features

- Converts numbers between bases 2 and 32.

- Supports conversion between decimal and other bases, including binary, octal, hexadecimal, etc.
- Simple interface for easy input and conversion.
- Remembers the last used bases for quick selection.

## Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler supporting C++17 or later (only if you want to compile it yourself).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.

2. Navigate into the Number_Base_Converter folder.

3. Open the commandline in the folder.

4. Compile the program using the following command (number_base_converter can be any name you want the Programm to have):

   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o number_base_converter

## Usage
1. Launch the program by running the executable.

2. Enter the number you wish to convert when prompted, followed by pressing Enter.

3. Enter the base of the number (between 2 and 32), followed by pressing Enter. The default base is 10.

4. Enter the target bases you want to convert the number to, followed by pressing Enter. You can choose from multiple bases like binary (2), octal (8), decimal (10), hexadecimal (16) (these are the default), or others between 2 and 32. Separate them using Spaces.

5. The program will display the converted number in the selected bases.

6. Optionally, you can convert another number by pressing enter and following the same process. If you want to quit the Programm press n and enter.
