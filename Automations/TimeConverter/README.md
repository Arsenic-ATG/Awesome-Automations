TIME CONVERTER

This small project will convert a specific unit of time to another specific unit of time. List of supported time units are: seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, decades.

Pre-requisite: None

How to use:
This is pretty straight forward. The program will ask you 3 times. The first time will be asking for the amount of the original unit of time. The second time will be asking for the original unit of time. The third time will be asking for the converted unit of time. The program will then print out the amount of the unit of time after converted.
