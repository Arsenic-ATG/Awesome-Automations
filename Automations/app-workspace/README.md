# App workspace

Say you have the boring task of manually opening apps for your specific purpose (work, entertainment, development,...). Sometimes you may even forget how to launch a program (if it is not added to your path or is tricky to open) and that leads to more time-consuming to prepare your apps-workspace.  
This program will help you save valuable time by saving all your running apps to a file and then later allow you to load all these apps at once with a single command. It even allows you to launch those apps in a new virtual desktop (if your computer supports it).
