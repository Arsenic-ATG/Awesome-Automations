### Things you will need to get it running  📈 :-

${thingsNeedToRun.map((thing) => `- ${thing}
`).join("")}

"### Additional packages 📝"

${additionalPackages.map((additional) => `- ${additional}
`).join("")}
${programmingLanguage === "javascript" || programmingLanguage === "js" || programmingLanguage === "Javascript" ?
        `#### But how do I install additonal packages? 🤨

- Make sure you have **nodejs** installed on your system. If you haven't yet go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org 'go to nodejs.org')

- If you want to install dependecies with **npm**
    - check for **yarn.lock**. If it is in root of directory. then DELETE **yarn.lock**
    - Now, run 'npm install'. This will install all the dependencies.

- If you want to install dependencies **yarn**.
    - check for **package-lock.json**. If it is in root of directory. then DELETE **package-lock.json**
    - Now, run 'yarn install' or 'yarn'. This will install all the dependencies.

### How to use this program ? 💻

-  If you want to run with **npm**
    - Run 'npm start'

- If you want to run with **yarn**
    - Run 'yarn start'

 #### But how do I install additonal packages? 🤨
- Make sure you have python package manager (**pip**) installed on your system
- Go to command line and type '''pip install <library name>''' { _pip3_ on mac }
